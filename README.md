# Multi User Communication Systems

# Multiple Access Protocols

Dedicated channels allocated to users are called multiple access. These techniques divide up the total signalling dimension into channels and then assign these channels to different users.

Some such protocols include

- Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
- Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
- Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)

# Random Access Protocols

Allocation of signaling dimensions for users with bursty transmissions generally use some form of random channel allocation which does not guarantee channel access. Bandwidth sharing using random channel allocation is called random multiple access or simply random access.

There are 3 types of random access protocols:

- ALOHA (Pure and Slotted)
- Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)
- Scheduling

# Multi User Channels

A multiuser channel refers to any channel that must be shared among multiple users.
The 2 types of multi-user channels are:

- Downlink
- Uplink

The downlink channel is also known as ‘Broadcast / Forward channel’ and the uplink channel is also known as ‘Multiple Access / Reverse channel’

# Some important factors to be considered

- Duplexing
- Channel Capacity
- Channel Model
- Noise Level and Performance Statistics
